    C and C++ both together are represented in around 11% of the projects currently being
    developed in the world today. <br><br> This makes these programming languages somewhat niche, and it's more

    - basics : vars and loops, exceptions, bitwise recursivity + including tail recursivity.</br>
    - data structures : vector, set, unordered map, list. </br>
    - memory : raw pointers, smart pointers, unique/shared/weak pointers + how is memory freed in each case.</br>
    - OOP concepts : classes,structs, & inheritance. conditional operator, virtual, operator overload.</br>
    - Cpp 11/14 concepts : iterators, auto, templates, move semantics, lambdas & range, size_t.</br>
